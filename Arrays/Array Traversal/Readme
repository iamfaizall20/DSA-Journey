Array Traversal

This folder contains solutions for various array traversal operations, including:

Reversing an Array: Reverses the array elements in place.
Printing Array Elements: Prints all elements of the array.
Summation of Elements: Calculates the sum of array elements.
Finding Maximum Element: Finds the maximum element in the array.
Finding Minimum Element: Finds the minimum element in the array.
Counting Occurrences: Counts the occurrences of a specific element in the array.
Finding Average: Calculates the average of the array elements.
Finding the First and Last Element: Retrieves the first and last elements of the array.
Checking if Array is Sorted: Determines if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.
Removing Duplicates: Removes duplicate elements from the array.
Merging Two Arrays: Merges two arrays into one.
Rotating the Array: Rotates the elements of the array by a given number of positions.
Shifting Elements: Shifts the elements of the array to the left or right by a given number of positions.
Finding Second Largest Element: Finds the second largest element in the array.
Finding the Missing Number: Identifies a missing number in a sequence (common in problems like "find the missing number from 1 to n").
Rearranging Array Elements: Rearranges the elements of the array (e.g., putting even numbers first and odd numbers later).
